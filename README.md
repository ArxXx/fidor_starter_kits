# FidorStarterKits

This repo features fidor application examples. The apps use oAuth to 
authenticate with fidor, so you must register an app at fidor first to get your 
personal app credentials. 
Afterwards just copy on of the /starter_kits, add your app credentials to the 
example source and start to play.

For Ruby Heros, this repo is also available as ruby gem and provides a tiny 
helper for app creation, see Install & Usage.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fidor_starter_kits'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fidor_starter_kits

## Usage

Create a zipped app with credentials and the fidor url:

```ruby

    opts = {
              app_name: 'sinatra_plain',
              client_id: 'my-client-id',
              client_secret: 'my-client-secret',
              app_url: 'http://my-app-url:3002',
              fidor_oauth_url: 'https://fidor-oauth-url.de/oauth',
              fidor_api_url: 'https://fidor-api-url.de/api_sandbox'
            }
        
    zip_file_path = FidorStarterKits.build(opts)
    # => /tmp/sinatra_plain-xyz/sinatra_plain.zip
    # => mv / cp / download is up to you babee

```
## Build your own starter kit

As a quickstart for new developers we zip and download the examples in our 
application manager. Before the following placeholders inside in your main 
example.xy file are substituted with the according values from the app:

    <APP_URL>                   # default http://localhost:8000/example.php
    <CLIENT_ID>
    <CLIENT_SECRET>
    <FIDOR_OAUTH_URL>           # e.g https://fidor.com/oauth
    <FIDOR_API_URL>

So just add those to example.[rb, php, ..] and see existing examples and specs 
for a reference.
