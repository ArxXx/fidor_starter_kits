# Fidor API simple starterkit with SDK for php

This is a simple web demo application to give developers a kick start in understanding OAuth and using our APIs.
It showcases the basic features of our APIs. No fancy screen design but clean, well commented and readable code so that
new developers can understand what's going on, learn how things should be done and even steal some lines of code for
their own projects.
