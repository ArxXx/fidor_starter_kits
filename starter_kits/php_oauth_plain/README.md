# Plain PHP oAuth Example

A single view that demonstrates the Fidor API OAuth login flow and how to get 
an access token.

## Usage

Start your local php server:

    php -S localhost:8000

And point your browser to http://localhost:8000/example.php

If you run the example under a different url, please update the url in the 
source file


## Configuration

In case you downloaded this project from the Fidor AppManager, all the
configuration should have already been set up for you. In case you
retrieved this example from another source, you'll need to open the
`example.php` file and fill in the configuration values at the top of the
file. You will be able to find out the values in the AppManager, create
a new App and use the configuration from the new App's detail page.
